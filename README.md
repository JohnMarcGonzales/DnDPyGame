<br>I like this one, It has a 5-minute timer, I love DnD, so why not? Also, it's RNG Yipee! </br>

<br>This Python-based dungeon crawler game, created by Signus (which is me I know it's cringy; I liked that name since I was a kid), utilizes the Pygame library to deliver a real-time, grid-based RPG experience with a 5-minute time limit, featuring a player-controlled green '@' symbol navigating procedurally generated dungeons while battling progressively challenging enemies, collecting loot, and avoiding traps. The game initializes with a 1920x1080 window, a 20x20 grid system, and 60 FPS, defining colors for walls (WHITE), floors (BLACK), traps (ORANGE/DARK ORANGE), and UI elements, with dungeon generation creating 10 interconnected rooms via generate_dungeon(), which employs a drunken walk algorithm for corridor connections and randomly places traps (80% room chance, split between 1d6-damage ORANGE and 1d8-damage DARKORANGE traps) in non-starting rooms. The player (Player class) starts in room 0 with 30 HP, AC 14, a dagger (1d6 damage), and leveling mechanics requiring XP from defeated enemies to increase stats (5 HP/level, +1 AC/level, +1 attack bonus/level), while enemies (Enemy/Boss classes) spawn sequentially across rooms 1-9, including Goblins, Orcs, a Dragon, and a final 5-headed Hydra boss with unique head-chopping mechanics, each with color-coded sprites (e.g., forest green Goblins, purple Dragon) determined by get_enemy_color(). Combat uses D&D-inspired rules: attack rolls (1d20 + player's attack bonus vs. enemy AC), damage rolls (weapon-specific dice), and trap evasion (DC 12 Dexterity check via 1d20), with messages logged to a scrollable top-center panel. Loot (Loot class) drops with an 80% probability of enemy death, offering weapons (e.g., 1d8 Sword, 2d6 Axe) with randomized rarity, automatically equipping when collected and displayed in the scrollable top-right equipment panel. UI elements include a top-left legend panel (scrollable via mouse wheel) listing enemy colors/names, a quit button (lower-right), and real-time displays of HP, AC, level, XP, and remaining time (converted from 300,000ms TIME_LIMIT). The main loop (main()) handles movement (WASD), collision detection, enemy encounters (triggered by overlapping tiles), trap interactions, inventory management, and win/loss conditions (time expiration, HP depletion, or Hydra defeat), rendering entities as colored grid squares and implementing smooth panel scrolling via offset variables. The Hydra boss features multi-head mechanics where successful attacks may reduce headcount instead of dealing damage, and victory triggers a 10-second "You Win!" message before exit. Code structure includes modular functions for dungeon drawing (draw_dungeon()), panel rendering (draw_legend_panel(), draw_equipment_panel()), dice rolls (roll_dice()), and event processing, with object-oriented design separating entities, enemies, and UI components for scalability.</br>
